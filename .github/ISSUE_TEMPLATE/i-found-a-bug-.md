## Issue
### Where does it occur?
In game? Or in Unity?

### Description
Describe the problem here in as much detail as you think it needs. What's going on?

## Reproduction
If needed, explain to me what I need to do in game (or in the Unity editor, for SDK bugs) in simple step-by-step instructions. If it doesn't always happen, that's okay - try to find when it does and find patterns, if you can.

## Severity
How urgent is this issue? Is it a minor inconvenience? Is it so bad that you can't use the mod or tool? Let me know here.
