# Avatar Extensions

Avatar Extensions is the name of a **hybrid SDK Plugin x MelonLoader mod** that allows you to **customize your avatar's stats and masses, and preview the vanilla values, all from within the SDK!** Now that's a fine sewer melon. 

# How To Install
There is a mod (that's this repo), and there's a Unity Package (for the editor, check the releases).

## Dependencies
* [Download BoneLib](https://bonelab.thunderstore.io/package/gnonme/BoneLib/)
* [Download FieldInjector](https://bonelab.thunderstore.io/package/WNP78/FieldInjector/)

The mod will not work without these two.

## I want to use custom stats on an avatar I installed!...

### ...And I am on PC
* Install MelonLoader. [Download it here](https://melonwiki.xyz/#/?id=automated-installation)
	* YOU MUST USE MELONLOADER 0.5.7 - IF YOU DO NOT, YOUR GAME WILL CRASH AND BREAK.
	* Launch the game without any mods installed. It will take longer than usual, but this sets it up for modding.
* Upgrade BONELAB to Patch 3 if you haven't already
	* Right click on the game in Steam, and click properties
	* Click on "Betas" on the side of the menu that opens up.
	* In the dropdown, select public_beta
	* Wait for the update to download.
* Install BoneLib if you haven't already. [Download BoneLib here](https://bonelab.thunderstore.io/package/gnonme/BoneLib/).
* Install FieldInjector if you haven't already. [Download FieldInjector here](https://bonelab.thunderstore.io/package/WNP78/FieldInjector/).
* Install this mod [by downloading it from the top most file from the Releases page](https://github.com/EtiTheSpirit/AvatarStatExtender/releases).
* Now, if you download (or make) any avatars that use the Stat Driver, they will load their custom stats!

### ...And I am on Quest
> âš  **NOTE:** This hasn't been tested on Quest and was not made for it. This mod might be very broken, and I have no way to fix it for Quest!

* Install LemonLoader. [Click here for a tutorial on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ax6vAd_lGsg)
* Upgrade BONELAB to Patch 3 if you haven't already
	* Go to the Oculus Store (or your game library) and select BONELAB.
	* Scroll down to Additional Details
	* Find Version, and choose the version number that is next to it.
	* Press the Channel button, and choose public_beta
	* The game should update. If it doesn't, try restarting your Quest.
* Install BoneLib if you haven't already. [Download BoneLib here](https://bonelab.thunderstore.io/package/gnonme/BoneLib/).
* Install FieldInjector if you haven't already. [Download FieldInjector here](https://bonelab.thunderstore.io/package/WNP78/FieldInjector/).
* Install this mod [by downloading it from the top most file from the Releases page](https://github.com/EtiTheSpirit/AvatarStatExtender/releases).
* Now, if you download (or make) any avatars that use the Stat Driver, they will load their custom stats!

## I want to make / upgrade an avatar to use custom stats!
* BACK UP YOUR UNITY PROJECT. It's not necessary, but it's usually a good idea, especially since this is still in testing phase.
* Install the Unity Editor Package [by downloading it from the top most file from the Releases page](https://github.com/EtiTheSpirit/AvatarStatExtender/releases).
* Open your Avatar project in Unity if you haven't already.
* Drag this .unitypackage file into your Unity application (into your Assets window, at the bottom).
	a. You will be prompted to unpack it and install its contents. Do this.
	b. Wait on Unity to load everything.
* Select your Avatar prefab. In the Inspector, click the "Add Component" button at the bottom and choose "Avatar Stat Driver".
* Customize everything! Everything has an explanation, hover your cursor over options or click the dropdowns under each value for an explanation.

# I'm a modder, how did you get the vanilla stats?
About a day straight in IDA, reading raw assembly, and translating it by hand to C#.

[Anyway, here's the code](https://github.com/EtiTheSpirit/AvatarStatExtender/blob/master/AvatarStatExtender/Tools/AvatarStatCalculationExtension.cs).

Documentation can be found [on my website](https://etithespir.it/bonelab/avatarextender/api/soundapi.html)

### Prototype Warning
This mod is currently a prototype and thus I have not yet released it on mod.io or thunderstore.

Additionally, features aren't final. I might remove stuff. I might add stuff.
